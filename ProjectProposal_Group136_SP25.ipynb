    "How does proximity to and the prevalence of public transit stations (bus or rail) influence rental prices across San Diego neighborhoods as well as over time (prior to station construction versus after operations were initiated), and at what average distance from any transit station does this price effect significantly diminish? Can we predict the price effect of planned transit developments on a neighborhood's rental pricing?",

"Housing and rent affordability has over the years become a center point of concern for residents of San Diego. We are interested in learning the dynamics and effects that the implementation of public transportation across neighborhoods of San Diego has on housing and rent affordability. Housing and transportation are on record for being the two largest household expenses according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, placing both household expenses as factors that directly contribute to cost of living.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Public transportation has in many ways made commuting much more accessible for residents. San Diego's Metropolitan Transit System has almost 100 fixed bus routes in operation, including urban, local, and rural routes.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) It also contains a light rail service that is operated by the SDTI system consisting of five separate lines, UC San Diego Blue, Green, Orange, Silver and Copper lines with a total  65 miles of rail across 62 stations.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) However, residents who do happen to live near transit are notably lower-income, and are experiencing the rise of costs in these areas as they increasingly become less affordable.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)",

"We are taking into consideration whether higher demand for housing near transit areas could potentially be the reason many individuals could find themselves priced out from areas with high amounts of accessible public transportation. A similar study was done analyzing the role of accessibility to buses in determining housing prices in Xiamen China that developed spatial econometric models that helped estimate global and local relationships between bus accessibility and housing prices(3). This study specifically focuses on whether there is an effect on property price and value through bus accessibility. The study findings suggest that accessibility to buses does positively affect nearby property prices, making them more high in demand, bus travel time to city centers and bus frequency also were found to have a significant effect on property prices(3).\n",

    "There should be no major ethical concerns regarding this project. Since we are collecting public data regarding prices of homes and distance from public transport, there should be no privacy concerns. There are two biases however, one being that tenants would mostly consist of middle/lower class people as its unlikely upper class people would be near public transport locations. This bias would work in our favor as the prices of rich homes would be a likely outlier, skweing our results. The other bias is that we are not including individual rental agreements as we are not easily able to access that kind of information. Without proper wording and clear communication of what we are reasearching, we could give a false sense of the prices of rent, which could lead to landlords taking advantage and raising rent with this reasearch as evidence. The way we will combat this potential issue is word our paper very explicitly about what we are measuring in this project.",
