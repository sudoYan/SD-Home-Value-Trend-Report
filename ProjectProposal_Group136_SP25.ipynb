    "There should be no major ethical concerns regarding this project. Since we are collecting public data regarding prices of homes and distance from public transport, there should be no privacy concerns. There are two biases however, one being that tenants would mostly consist of middle/lower class people as its unlikely upper class people would be near public transport locations. This bias would work in our favor as the prices of rich homes would be a likely outlier, skweing our results. The other bias is that we are not including individual rental agreements as we are not easily able to access that kind of information. Without proper wording and clear communication of what we are reasearching, we could give a false sense of the prices of rent, which could lead to landlords taking advantage and raising rent with this reasearch as evidence. The way we will combat this potential issue is word our paper very explicitly about what we are measuring in this project. ",
