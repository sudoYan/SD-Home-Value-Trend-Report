This project analyzes neighborhood proximity to public transit and its effect on home values in San Diego. We will be creating a continuous Difference-in-Differences(DID) estimator model across the neighborhoods, categorizing changes in transit stop scores as the "treatment" groups allowing us to estimate the causal impact of transit stop scores on neighborhood home values as an aggregate on logarithmic trends.
